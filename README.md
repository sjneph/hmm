## Scalable Hidden Markov Model ##
> Shane Neph

This was inspired by an R package I once played with, but is written to scale to big data.

To-Do
======
There is more testing/verification left to do, as well as some design changes.  See doc/todo.txt for details.

There is no official built-in application to use the functions written yet.  That will be checked in next.  There is a small test application in share/ where I've shown how to use the various aspects of the library.
